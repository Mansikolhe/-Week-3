This project predicts solar power generation using machine learning and historical weather data to optimize energy distribution. It compares Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks, evaluates performance (RMSE, RÂ²), and visualizes actual vs. predicted output. Future scope: Deep Learning &amp; real-time data integration. ðŸš€
